# SymbolicOctaveLatex
OctLatex.m is a very simple script intended to enable the user to programmatically include the results of Octave computations in Latex documents; the focus is on symbolic computations but numerics and figures can also be
used. Hence it is similar in purpose to the various “sweave” packages that exist for Matlab, SageMath, R, Python
etc. But the emphasis of OctLatex is on simplicity.

Keywords: Latex, Octave, Symbolic
